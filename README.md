# Web-Scrapping-Using-Python

#Description
 
1. This is a Webscrapping Script Using Python module. 
2. I have used Python urllib module to connect to the website and used popular webscrapping module beautiful Soup (bs4) for scrapping Web contents.
3. Here i have used 2 scripts "webscrapping.py" used for scrapping web contents and place the contents in a excel sheet in a very readable and formatted manner. 
4. "Notification.py" is used for the same procedure scrapping the web contents and we are not saving the data in excel sheet. Instead of that we are getting live notification to the desktop from website in the form of dailog box popup. 
5. This code is used only to read and understand the logic. Copying this code is Strictly Prohibited by Nishanth T.
